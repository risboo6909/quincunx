# quincunx

Galton board simulation.

I wanted to learn WebAssembly for a long time because this technology looks very appealing to me as it allows to write high performance web applications using one of my favorite language - Rust. 

This project is my first attempt to make something using this technology. I've spent plenty amount of time thinking about iteresting and not too much complicated idea which would however involve 3d graphics and physics simulation.

Hope that Galton board is the right thing.
